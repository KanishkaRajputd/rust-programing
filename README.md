# rust-programing

<p>On Windows, go to https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install and follow the instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll receive a message explaining that you’ll also need the MSVC build tools for Visual Studio 2013 or later.</p>

<p>$ rustc --version</p>

<p> When you install npm you also check for node js similarly when you install rust you have to check for cargo</p>
<p>$ cargo --version</p>

<p>It will give you same version as rust</p>

<h2>Let's create a folder for working in rust with using cargo</h2>

<p>$ cargo new test-project</p>
<p>$ cd test-project</p>

<p> For running the program use $ cargo run</p>
